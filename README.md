## Objectives of Project

There is currently no reliable way to buy or sell items locally with certainty of the buyer or sellerâ€™s authenticity. The objective of our website is to create a platform to facilitate buying and selling products in a small community with an ability to offer on a suggested price and leave user feedback.

## What ShopSJSU Offers

Registered users can post an item to sell on the ShopSJSU platform by entering a product name, price, description and image. Authenticated users are able to browse items for sale posted by other students on the home page and can message sellers directly within the application to arrange a transaction in person. Sellers can also filter by items that they have posted and are able to edit their own items. Users not registered in the ShopSJSU database can still browse items for sale via the home page but cannot message sellers.
